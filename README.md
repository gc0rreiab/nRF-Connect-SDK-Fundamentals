# nRF-Connect-SDK-Fundamentals
Repo for my hands-on during nRF Connect SDK Fundamentals course

Nordic Semiconductor has deprecated the old nRF5 SDK and now all the new features are developed for their new SDK called nRF Connect which is based on [Zephyr RTOS](https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr).
